# Coastal Data Site Sonification + Visuals

This is being done as a part of my INFO-I 310 final. It is a sonification of coastal U.S. archaeological site data, along with a simple visualization done in OpenGl. The data used is taken from landmark work by Anderson et al on the effect of sea-level rise from climate change on coastal archaeological sites. Made in Max/MSP.
